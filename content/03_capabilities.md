# Capabilities

<!-- What gaps / issues does the software need to address? -->
As the old software dropped support on managing confined spaces a new software should fill in the gaps. For continuous improvements of the software, it is divided up into multiple releases cycles with increasing amount of functionality and complexity.

![Software Release Roadmap](images/cs-release-plan.png)

In order for the application to quickly be deployed into the field, the first two releases only consist of a very basic feature set to indicate whether there is an ongoing operation or not. With each release the application should evolve into a more complex and feature-rich application.

The complete ecosystem should consist of multiple applications that should all fulfill a different purpose.

## Terminal

The Terminal application is deployed to the complete fleet of vehicles throughout the fire department. Each truck has one or more Windows based computers mounted to the dashboard of the vehicle. A small application, mimicking the functionality of a LED should indicate to everyone onboard that there is an active confined space operation.

<!-- What gets done with that information? -->

<!-- TODO: Image of the Fire Truck -->

## Trigger
This application gets used by the dispatchers of the fire department. As the name implies it is a simple trigger application that

<!-- What hardware is the application deployed on? -->

## Dispatcher
With the introduction of Version 3 the Trigger application will be replaced by a better application that should allow dispatchers to control operations with far more precision.

<!-- TODO: Add Mindmap -->

<!-- TODO: Important Metrics, like Oxygen requirements should be highlighted -->

<!-- How have they been dispatching operations currently? -->

**Version 3.0**:

Through a custom build user interface the application should help operators to easily manage multiple confined operations

**Version 4.0**:

<!-- Map Feature -->
<!-- Search -->
<!-- Forms -->
  <!-- Hazard Assesment for new confined spaces -->
<!-- Warning when infromation of the confined space is outdated -->
  <!-- Warn the operator -->
