# Conclusion

<!-- What have I achived with this thesis? -->
<!-- What have I learned? -->
<!-- What problems have I solved? -->
<!-- Will they further use this software for their operations? -->

<!-- Could this application be distributed to other fire departments? -->

In the future I could imagine a system where IOT sensors are connected to this software and report back live measurements of machine states and environmental conditions inside the confined space.

<!-- TODO: Rewrite -->
Some companies are already testing the use of autonomous inspection robots for inspecting confined spaces, this would reduce the risk of accidents even greater.
