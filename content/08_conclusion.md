# Conclusion

<!-- What have I achived with this thesis? -->
<!-- What have I learned? -->
<!-- What problems have I solved? -->
<!-- Will they further use this software for their operations? -->

<!-- Could this application be distributed to other fire departments? -->

As I already planned for a way to connect on-sight sensors to the application this would be the next step the application can take.

<!-- TODO: Rewrite -->
For confined space inspection some companies already test the use of autonomous robots and drones that are equipped with sensors to detect and report on the safety of a confined space.
