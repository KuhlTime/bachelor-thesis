<!-- Goal: 2000 Words -->
# System Design
<!-- The chapter should describe the applications on a high level. Not the implementation. No languages and no code! -->

<!-- What is the architecture of this application? -->
  <!-- What do books recommend on how a good system architecture should look like? -->

<!-- How are the connections between the different Application modeled? -->

<!-- How should the application data be modeled? -->

<!-- What qualitiy / security standards need to be set? -->
  <!-- What defines a software to be of high quality? - See:  Ensuring the Software Quality for Critical Infrastructure Objects -->
  <!-- How should issues and crashes be handled? -->
  <!-- What Fallback is there in case of a malfuntion or a complete system outage? -->
  <!-- What are common errors that need to be prevented? e.g. User error (Incorrect use), Network Connectivity -->
  <!-- What happens when there is no network connection? -->

  <!-- What is static Code Quality Analysis? How does it work? -->

  <!-- How is the application protected against hackers? -->
  <!-- What attack surfaces does the application poses? -->
  <!-- What are the consquences of someone breaching different parts of the system -->
  <!-- How can this be prevented? -->

  <!-- How is future provness guaranteed? -->


<!-- How should the UI function? -->
<!-- How can incorrect usage of the application be prevented? How does the UI reflect these protections? -->
<!-- What DevOps Pipelines need to be developed? -->

<!-- What technologies / libraries have been used? -->
  <!-- What part of the application is each software used for? -->
  <!-- What are the benefits / disadvantages of the technology used? -->

<!-- What database should be used? What features should it poses? -->
  <!-- How is logging of changes enabled? -->

<!-- What parts of the application need testing scripts in order to continously check their correct behaviour? -->
