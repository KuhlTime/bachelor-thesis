# Introduction

<!-- Note of thanks -->
First, I wanted to give a huge thanks to Kelly Bellefleuer and the entire fire department of Campbell River. All of them have taken lots of time out of their schedule to make this software a reality, answered all of my questions and given me essential feedback on how to improve the software.
I also want to thank my professor, Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Wolfgang Lux and his assistant Frederik Feichtmeier B. Eng. for providing me with help along the way of writing this thesis.

## Overview

In conjuction with the fire deperatment of Campbell River, a town in the west of Canada I set out to create a software that would help them to schedule operations in so called "confined spaces". Confined spaces being areas which are not designed for permanent human occupancy and therefore might pose a risk to human safety. In case of an emergency the staff is obligated to help with the rescue of any person in the confined space.

## Thesis Structure
The thesis is devided into several different parts. Each of which builds up on the previous one.
After giving an overview on what needs to be achived and which features need to be implemented, I will go into more detail on how the whole system is conceptualized and how it was implemented. Everything is then followed up by summarizing what issues have been resolved and what could be improved.

<!-- How will I address this issue? -->
## Problem
As the old software no longer supports these kinds of operations a replacement is needed. By planning and developing a multitude of different applications the whole process from organizing to rescue will be streamlined and improved. As the software is vital to perform, reliabilty and secruity will be of major concern.
