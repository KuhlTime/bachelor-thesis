# Fundamentals
<!-- The CRFD explained -->
  <!-- Where are they located? -->
The city of Campbell River is located in the western part of Canada. It is the second-largest city on Vancouver Island. With a total population of more than 37,800 permanent residents. @cityofcampbellriver_2019_connect
The city is reachable via car, ferry, plane and seaplane and is about a 30-minute flight away from the metropolis of Vancouver.

The Campbell River Fire Department ... . <!-- TODO: Finish sentence -->
The main fire station is located near the town center and houses X fire trucks. The fire station and its 10 operators serve a total of 49 different fire stations located all across Vancouver Island. Any incoming emergency calls get captured and then forwarded to the appropriate station. @cityofcampbellriver_campbell

## Confined Spaces
<!-- How does the legislation for cs in Canada look like? -->
<!-- TODO: Declutter, does not look good for opener -->
As defined by the Canadian Department of Justice, inside the **Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** ((+COHSR)) a **Confined Space** is met by the following criteria @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

A space that...

a. is enclosed or partially enclosed;
b. is not designed or intended for continuous human
occupancy; and
c. has a limited or restricted means of entry or exit or
an internal configuration that could complicate provision of first aid, evacuation, rescue or other emergency
response.

<!-- What classification of cs are there? -->
A confined space can be classified as a **Hazardous Confined Space** when human health or life might be at danger due to one of the following conditions @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

a. its design, construction, location or atmosphere;
b. the materials or substances in it; or
c. any other conditions relating to it.

A confined space is considered **Hot Work** if any source of fire or ignition is present. @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01)

![Confined Spaces Classification - Source: Author](images/cs-classification.png)

Inside a confined space one might encounter one or more of the following hazards. @govermentofcanada_2021_confined:

- **Physical Hazard**
  like 
  *noise*, *engulfment*, *flooding*, *moving machinery*, *extreme temperatures*, *radiation*, *fire*, *explosions*, ...
- **Biological Hazard**
  like
  *mould*, *bacteria*, *viruses*, *blood-borne pathogens*, *biological toxins*, ...
- **Chemical Hazard**
  like
  *gases*, *vapors*, *fumes*, *chemical asphyxiant*, *lack of oxygen*, *asbestos*, *lead*, ...
- **Electrical Hazard**
  like
  *exposed wiring*, *electrical panels*, ...
- **Ergonomic Hazard**
  like
  *maintaining a difficult posture*, *repetitive strain*, *lifting*, *awkward reaching*, *use of hand tools*, ...
- **Psychological Hazard**
  like
  *working alone*, *claustrophobia*, *fatigue*, ...

Confined spaces are commonly part of a fabrication sites or public infrastructure and can be anything from a chemical tank to a sewage pipe. In order to protect workers entering these spaces, strict guidelines are put into place. @bellefleur_2022_in @govermentofcanada_2021_confined

<!-- TODO: Rewrite -->
Before a person is allowed to enter a confined space the employer first needs to perform, what is called a confined spaces identification and a hazard assessment, as described in subsection 11.02 to 11.03 of the (+COHSR). @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304

<!-- Does there need to be an emergency responder on sight? -->

### Identification

The identification process is a way of determining if there are any confined spaces on sight and whether they need to be classified as hazardous. Together with a qualified person, which is either someone from the work place committee or a health and safety representative the following actions are mandatory to be carried out:

1. The qualified person has to identify all confined and hazardous confined spaces.
2. The qualified person has to provide a catalog of all the confined and hazardous confined spaces that have been located in (1).
3. It is the employer's duty to properly sign these areas to prevent anyone from entering them.
4. The employer has to keep the record readily available. This document has to be updated / reviewed either every 3 years @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03) or whenever the conditions of that particular confined space changed.
5. Before someone is granted access to a **none**-hazardous confined space. The employer needs to ensure that safety measures such as "person-check and emergency response systems" @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.02.5) are put into place.

The previously mentioned steps have been broken down to their core concepts. The full legislatory definitions are part of the subsection 11.02 of the (+COHSR) @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304.

<!-- NOTE: A person is never allowed to enter a confined space on their own. They always need someone that  -->

### Hazard Assessment

For every confined space the employer has to produce a detailed hazard report. The report has to include the following information @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03) @govermentofcanada_2021_confined:

<!-- TODO: Reorder list -->
- The date at which the report was created.
- An extensive list of all the hazards a person entering that space may encounter. Each hazard has to have a resolution on how a certain threat can be prevented, controlled or extinguished.
- It needs to mention which equipment is required on site by the worker entering that space and what equipment might be required by the first aid responders.
- What checks and tasks have to be performed before someone is allowed access to the confined space.
- It needs to clarify the way of getting approval to enter that space.
- Any additional information for the worker or the emergency responders has to be stated.

<!-- TODO: What is an Entry Permit System? @govermentofcanada_2021_confined -->

Only persons that have certain training and are qualified to perform a hazard assessment and are allowed to fill out such a report. In case of any accidents that have to do with a lack of information on that report they are held responsible and might face legal consequences. 
@canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03) @govermentofcanada_2021_confined 

<!-- TODO: Reread -->
Just like the identification of the confined spaces has to be reviewed every 3 years and updated as soon as any changes happen to that confined space the hazards have to be reassessed as well. An exception being when the confined space was not entered in the previous 3 years and is not planed to be entered. @govermentofcanada_2021_confined
