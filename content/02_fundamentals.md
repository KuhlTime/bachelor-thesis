## Confined Spaces
<!-- How does the legislation for cs in Canada look like? -->
<!-- TODO: Declutter, does not look good for opener -->
As defined by the Canadian department of justice, inside the **Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** ((+OHS)) a **Confined Space** is met by the following criteria @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

A space that...

a. is enclosed or partially enclosed;
b. is not designed or intended for continuous human
occupancy; and
c. has a limited or restricted means of entry or exit or
an internal configuration that could complicate provision of first aid, evacuation, rescue or other emergency
response.

<!-- What classification of cs are there? -->
A confined space can be classified as a **Hazardous Confined Space** when human health or life might be at danger due to one of the following conditions @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

a. its design, construction, location or atmosphere;
b. the materials or substances in it; or
c. any other conditions relating to it.

A confined space is considered **Hot Work** if any source of fire or ignition is present. @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01)

Inside a confined space one might encounter one or more of the following hazards @govermentofcanada_2021_confined:

- **Physical Hazard**
  like 
  *noise*, *engulfment*, *flooding*, *moving machinery*, *extreme temperatures*, *radiation*, *fire*, *explosions*, ...
- **Biological Hazard**
  like
  *mould*, *bacteria*, *viruses*, *blood-borne pathogens*, *biological toxins*, ...
- **Chemical Hazard**
  like
  *gases*, *vapors*, *fumes*, *chemical asphyxiant*, *lack of oxygen*, *asbestos*, *lead*, ...
- **Electrical Hazard**
  like
  *exposed wiring*, *electrical panels*, ...
- **Ergonomic Hazard**
  like
  *maintaining a difficult posture*, *repetitive strain*, *lifting*, *awkward reaching*, *use of hand tools*, ...
- **Psychological Hazard**
  like
  *working alone*, *claustrophobia*, *fatigue*, ...

Confined spaces are commonly part of a fabrication sites or public infrastructure and can be anything from a chemical tank to a sewage pipe. In order to protect workers entering these spaces, strict guidelines are put into place. @bellefleur_2022_in

<!-- TODO: Rewrite -->
Before a person is allowed to enter a confined space the employer first needs to perform, what is called a confined spaces identification and a hazard assessment, as described in subsection 11.02 to 11.03 of the (+OHS). @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304

<!-- Does there need to be an emergency responder on sight? -->

### Identification

The identification process is a way of determine if there are any confined spaces on sight and whether they need to be classified as hazardous. 

@canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.02)

### Hazard Assessment

For every confined space the employer has to produce a detailed Hazard Report. The Report has to include the following information @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03):

<!-- TODO: Reorder list -->
- The date at which the report was created.
- An extensive list of all the hazards a person entering that space may encounter. Each hazard has to have a resolution on how a certain threat can be prevented, controlled or extinguished.
- It needs to mention which equipment is required on site by the worker entering that space and what equipment might be required by the first aid responders.
- What checks and tasks have to be performed before someone is allowed access to the confined space.
- It needs to clarify the way of getting approval to enter that space.
- Any additional information for the worker or the emergency responders has to be stated.

Only persons that have certain training and are qualified to perform a hazard assessment are allowed to fill out such a report. In case of any accidents that have to do with a lack of information on that report they are held responsible and might face legal consequences. @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03)
