<!-- The CRFD explained -->
  <!-- Where are they located? -->
The city of Campbell River is located in the western part of Canada. It is the second-largest city on Vancouver Island with a total population of more than 37,800 permanent residents. @cityofcampbellriver_2019_connect
The city is reachable via car, plane and seaplane and is about a 30-minute flight away from the metropolis of Vancouver.

The Campbell River Fire Department (in this work often abbreviated with *CRFD*) ... . <!-- TODO: Finish sentence -->
The main fire station is located near the town center and houses X fire trucks. The fire station and its 10 operators serve a total of 49 different fire stations located all across Vancouver Island. Any incoming emergency calls get captured and then forwarded to the appropriate station.

## Confined Spaces
<!-- How does the legislation for cs in Canada look like? -->
<!-- TODO: Declutter, does not look good for opener -->
As defined by the Canadian department of justice, inside the **Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**, short *OHS* a confined space is met by the following criteria @departmentofjusticecanada_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

A space that...

1. Is enclosed or partially enclosed
2. Is not designed or intended for continuous human occupancy
3. Has a limited or restricted means of entry or exit or an internal configuration that could complicate provision of first aid, evacuation, rescue or other emergency response 

<!-- What classification of cs are there? -->
A confined space can be classified as a **Hazardous Confined Space** when human health or life might be at danger due to one of the following conditions:

Its...

1. design, construction, location or atmosphere
2. substances and materials in it, *or*
3. any other danger arising from entering or exiting that space

A confined space is considered **Hot Work** if any source of fire or ignition is present.

Inside a confined space one might encounter one or more of the following hazards @govermentofcanada_2021_confined:

- **Physical Hazard**
  like 
  *noise*, *engulfment*, *flooding*, *moving machinery*, *extreme temperatures*, *radiation*, *fire*, *explosions*, ...
- **Biological Hazard**
  like
  *mould*, *bacteria*, *viruses*, *blood-borne pathogens*, *biological toxins*, ...
- **Chemical Hazard**
  like
  *gases*, *vapors*, *fumes*, *chemical asphyxiant*, *lack of oxygen*, *asbestos*, *lead*, ...
- **Electrical Hazard**
  like
  *exposed wiring*, *electrical panels*, ...
- **Ergonomic Hazard**
  like
  *maintaining a difficult posture*, *repetitive strain*, *lifting*, *awkward reaching*, *use of hand tools*, ...
- **Psychological Hazard**
  like
  *working alone*, *claustrophobia*, *fatigue*, ...

Confined spaces are commonly part of a fabrication sites or public infrastructure and can be anything from a chemical tank to a sewage pipe. In order to protect workers entering these spaces, strict guidelines are put into place. @bellefleur_2022_in

<!-- TODO: Rewrite -->
Before a person is allowed to enter a confined space the employer first needs to perform, what is called a confined spaces identification and a hazard assessment, as described in subsection 11.02 to 11.03 of the Canadian *OHS*. It mandates that any entity retaining confined spaces needs to have a detailed hazard report on site. 

<!-- Does there need to be an emergency responder on sight? -->

### Identification

An employer has to ensure that all its governing confined spaces are correctly 

### Hazard Assessment

For every confined space the employer has to produce a detailed Hazard Report. The Report has to include the following information:

<!-- TODO: Reorder list -->
- The date at which the report was created.
- An extensive list of all the hazards a person entering that space may encounter. Each hazard has to have a resolution on how a certain threat can be prevented, controlled or extinguished.
- It needs to mention which equipment is required on site by the worker entering that space and what equipment might be required by the first aid responders.
- What checks and tasks have to be performed before someone is allowed access to the confined space.
- It needs to clarify the way of getting approval to enter that space.
- Any additional information for the worker or the emergency responders has to be stated.

Only persons that have certain training and are qualified to perform a hazard assessment are allowed to fill out such a report. In case of any accidents that have to do with a lack of information on that report they are held responsible and might face legal consequences.

## Computer-Aided Dispatch Software
*CAD* is a special category of software that's helping to dispatch emergency services such as police and firefighters. The software is used to provide a common flow for handling incoming emergencies and to ensure a high agility and quick response to calls.
