# Fundamentals
<!-- The CRFD explained -->
  <!-- Where are they located? -->
The city of Campbell River is located in the western part of Canada. It is the second-largest city on Vancouver Island. With a total population of more than 37,800 permanent residents @cityofcampbellriver_2019_connect.
The city is reachable via car, ferry, plane and seaplane and is about a 30-minute flight away from the metropolis of Vancouver.

The Campbell River Fire Department ... . <!-- TODO: Finish sentence -->
The main fire station is located near the town center and houses X fire trucks. The fire station and its 10 operators serve a total of 49 different fire stations located all across Vancouver Island. Any incoming emergency calls get captured and then forwarded to the appropriate station @cityofcampbellriver_campbell.

## Confined Spaces
<!-- How does the legislation for cs in Canada look like? -->
<!-- TODO: Declutter, does not look good for opener -->
As defined by the Canadian Department of Justice, inside the **Occupational Health and Safety Regulations** ((+COHSR)) a **Confined Space** is met by the following criteria @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

A space that...

a. is enclosed or partially enclosed;
b. is not designed or intended for continuous human
occupancy; and
c. has a limited or restricted means of entry or exit or
an internal configuration that could complicate provision of first aid, evacuation, rescue or other emergency
response.

<!-- What classification of cs are there? -->
A confined space can be classified as a **Hazardous Confined Space** when human health or life might be at danger due to one of the following conditions @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01):

a. its design, construction, location or atmosphere;
b. the materials or substances in it; or
c. any other conditions relating to it.

A confined space is considered **Hot Work** if any source of fire or ignition is present. @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.01)

Figure 1 shows a visual representation of the different kind of classifications.

Inside a confined space one might encounter one or more of the following hazards @governmentofcanada_2021_confined, @mcpherson_2020_webinar:

- **Physical Hazard**
  like 
  *noise*, *engulfment*, *flooding*, *moving machinery*, *extreme temperatures*, *radiation*, *fire*, *explosions*, ...
- **Biological Hazard**
  like
  *mould*, *bacteria*, *viruses*, *blood-borne pathogens*, *biological toxins*, ...
- **Chemical Hazard**
  like
  *gases*, *vapors*, *fumes*, *chemical asphyxiant*, *lack of oxygen*, *asbestos*, *lead*, ...
- **Electrical Hazard**
  like
  *exposed wiring*, *electrical panels*, ...
- **Ergonomic Hazard**
  like
  *maintaining a difficult posture*, *repetitive strain*, *lifting*, *awkward reaching*, *use of hand tools*, ...
- **Psychological Hazard**
  like
  *working alone*, *claustrophobia*, *fatigue*, ...

<!-- TODO: List more exampled brought up in @governmentofcanada_2021_confined -->
Confined spaces are commonly part of a fabrication sites or public infrastructure and can be anything from a chemical tank to a sewage pipe. In order to protect workers entering these spaces, strict guidelines are put into place @bellefleur_2022_in, @governmentofcanada_2021_confined.

<!-- Does there need to be an emergency responder on sight? -->

### Legislation <!-- TODO: Is it a regulation or legislation? -->

Before a person is allowed to enter a confined space the employer first needs to perform, what is called a confined spaces identification and a hazard assessment, as described in subsection 11.02 to 11.03 of the (+COHSR) @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304. From there on up a procedure for safe entry and exit can be established.

#### Identification

The identification process is a way of determining if there are any confined spaces on sight and whether they need to be classified as hazardous. Together with a qualified person, which is either someone from the work place committee or a health and safety representative the following actions are mandatory to be carried out:

1. The qualified person has to identify all confined and hazardous confined spaces.
2. The qualified person has to provide a catalog of all the confined and hazardous confined spaces that have been located in (1).
3. It is the employer's duty to properly sign these areas to prevent anyone from entering them.
4. The employer has to keep the record readily available. This document has to be updated / reviewed either every 3 years @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03) or whenever the conditions of that particular confined space change.
5. Before someone is granted access to a **none**-hazardous confined space. The employer needs to ensure that safety measures such as "person-check and emergency response systems" @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.02.5) are put into place.

The previously mentioned steps have been broken down to their core concepts. The full legislatory definitions are part of the subsection 11.02 of the (+COHSR) @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304.

<!-- NOTE: A person is never allowed to enter a confined space on their own. They always need someone that  -->

#### Hazard Assessment

For every confined space the assigned qualified person has to produce a detailed hazard report. The report has to include the following information @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03), @governmentofcanada_2021_confined:

<!-- TODO: Reorder list -->
- The date at which the report was created.
- An extensive list of all the hazards a person entering that space may encounter. Each hazard has to have a resolution on how a certain threat can be prevented, controlled or extinguished.
- It needs to mention which equipment is required on site by the worker entering that space and what equipment might be required by the first aid responders.
- What checks and tasks have to be performed before someone is allowed access to the confined space.
- It needs to clarify the way of getting approval to enter that space.
- Any additional information for the worker or the emergency responders has to be stated.

<!-- TODO:  (2)(f) any situation in which an entry permit system is required. -->
<!-- TODO: What is an Entry Permit System? @governmentofcanada_2021_confined -->

Only persons that have certain training and are qualified to perform a hazard assessment and are allowed to fill out such a report @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.03), @governmentofcanada_2021_confined. In case of any accidents that have to do with a lack of information on that report they are held responsible and might face legal consequences. 
<!-- TODO: Find ressource legal consequences -->

<!-- TODO: Reread -->
Just like the identification of the confined spaces has to be reviewed every 3 years and updated as soon as any changes happen to that confined space the hazards have to be reassessed as well. An exception being when the confined space was not entered in the previous 3 years and is not planed to be entered @governmentofcanada_2021_confined. 

#### Establishing Procedures

From the previous two reports a procedure for a safe entry and exit of a confined space can be derived. The procedures will establish a roadmap for all the actors involved. Every confined space needs to have "safe entry and exit procedures", "two-way communication and person check systems" and "emergency response measures" @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.04(2)(a)). <!-- TODO: Not entirely sure! --> In case of a hazardous confined space the procedure plan has to state which safety tests need to be run and what equipment has to be prepared for both the workers and the emergency response personal. @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.04).

In case an entry permit system^[An **entry permit system** is a further safety system that includes a governing instance controlled by the employer. Its task is to schedule operations and hand out permits to the workers entering a hazardous confined space @usdepartmentofhomelandsecurity_2011_tech.] is in place the qualified person has to fill out a permit handed out by the employer. <!-- TODO: Rewrite --> A permit holds additional information about the hazardous confined space.  @canadiandepartmentofjustice_2022_sor86304 (11.04(3))

Depending on the type of hazard found in a confined space special rules and thresholds may apply. See subsection 11.05(1) of the (+COHSR).

<!-- How does the flow of entering a confined space look like? Flow-Chart -->
<!-- What happens in case of an emegrency? -->
<!-- What equipment is needed to perform an operation inside a confined space? -->

### Standards

A standard is a guideline which was established by a group of expert in a certain topic. Whilst regulations build the basis, standards ensures that certain tasks are performed with quality and efficiency in mind @foundationofcannabisunifiedstandardsinc_standards. 

Common standards for operating a confined space in Canada are the (+CSA) Z1006 and the (+NFPA) 350 @mcpherson_2020_webinar.

### Incidents

In Canada alone, the Canadian rescue training provider Roco Rescue recorded an average of 128 fatalities per year, in the timespan from 2011 to 2018 @rocorescueinc_2021_confined. With 61% most casualties happen due to physical injuries such as falling objects and engulfment. 34% account to atmospheric hazards like "toxic chemicals, oxygen deficiency or combustible dust" @mcpherson_2020_webinar.

As there are not a lot of statistics concerning injuries or fatalities in confined space, numbers may depend on the source of information.

In presentations by two engineers of 3M, they state that 60% of all casualties happen to would-be rescuers^[**Would-be rescuer** Rescuer that died during the rescue mission] @mcpherson_2020_webinar, @meyer_2019_confined. These numbers go back to a study from 1986 and are rendered incorrect by an Australian study from 2019. 

"In 1986, NIOSH issued an alert which concluded that ‚ÄòMore than 60% of confined space fatalities occur among would-be rescuers‚Äô (NIOSH, 1986). The sample size used to produce this alert was very small and had no stated selection criteria. An analysis of a number of studies since by Selman et al. (2018 - Chapter 4 of this work) found that proportion of rescuer fatalities was much lower, and no more than 17% of all deaths" @selmon_2019_workrelated.

## Computer-Aided Dispatch Software

Computer-Aided Dispatch ((+CAD)), not to be misunderstood with Computer-Aided Design^[**Computer-Aided Design** misleadingly also referred to as CAD-Software is a software that's main purpose lays in the creation of digital construction plans and three-dimensional (3d) models. It is typically used in mechanical engineering, civil engineering and $\\$ electrical engineering. @autodeskinc_cad] is a special category of software that's helping to dispatch emergency services such as police and fire stations @a2021_computeraided. The software is used to provide a common flow for handling incoming emergencies -- to ensure a high agility and quick response to incoming emergency calls @usdepartmentofhomelandsecurity_2011_tech, @apcointernational_2012_public.

More modern implementations of such a software are oftentimes referred to as **Next-Generation 911** ((+NG911)). 911 being the common emergency number in North-America @a2022_911. Whereas traditional dispatchment software was focused on "static land-line connections" @arcgisbyesriinc_ng911 (+NG911) focuses on providing advanced functionalities such as:

- processing of send video, audio and text messages @usnational911program_911gov
- they are able to receive data from different "transmitting devices such as wearable medical devices, car computers and building alarms" @usnational911program_911gov
- intercommunication between different departments and emergency services @usnational911program_911gov

These features allow for better emergency service through new ways of communication and enable faster response times to incoming accidents.
