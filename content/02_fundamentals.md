<!-- TODO: Declutter, does not look good for opener -->
As defined by the Canadian department of justice, inside the **Occupational Health and Safety Regulations**, short *OHS* in subsection 11.01 a Confined Space (CS) is met by the following criteria @departmentofjusticecanada_2022_sor86304:

1. Is enclosed or partially enclosed
2. Is not designed or intended for continuous human occupancy
3. Has a limited or restricted means of entry or exit or an internal configuration that could complicate provision of first aid, evacuation, rescue or other emergency response 

<!-- What classification of cs are there? -->
A CS can be classified as a **Hazardous Confined Space** when human health or life might be at danger do to the following conditions:

Due to its...

1. design, construction, location or atmosphere
2. substances and materials in it, *or*
3. any other danger arising from entering or exiting that space

Furthermore, a confined space can be considered **Hot Work** if any source of fire or ignition is present inside the confined space.

CS are mostly part of a fabrication site or public infrastructure and can be anything from a chemical tank to a sewage pipe. In order to protect workers entering these spaces, strict operation flows are forced up on these companies.

<!-- TODO: Rewrite -->
Before a person is allowed to enter a confined space the employer first needs to perform, what is called confined spaces identification and a hazard assessment, as described in subsection 11.02 to 11.03 of the Canadian *OHS*.
