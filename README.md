| Fundamentals   |      `6` |
| Capabilities   |      `4` |
| System Design  |     `12` |
| Implementation |      `8` |
| Evaluation     |      `4` |
| Conclusion     |      `2` |

## Tell a story

Taken from 
- [Writing a Bachelor Thesis in Computer Science](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~nijssensgr/bachelorklas-2014-2015/writing.pdf)

**MOST IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY**: First outline and then fill in the gaps. "Iterate, Iterate, Iterate"

The 3 steps to follow:

     - Motivation examples
2. **Problem Description - What?**
   - Requirements
   - Specification of the desirable functionality a user interface should have
   - Specification of the desirable functionality the application should have
3. **Approach - How?**
   - Architecture of the system I am Building
   - Description of the technologies (languages, services, libraries) used
   - Last: Implementation Details

**More:**
- Anyone with a degree comparable degree should be able to read the thesis

- Active tense, **not** passive tense
