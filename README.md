## Writing Goals

| Chapter        |      Words |
| -------------- | ---------: |
| Introduction   |      `300` |
| Fundamentals   |      `700` |
| Capabilities   |      `500` |
| System Design  |     `2000` |
| Implementation |     `1500` |
| Evaluation     |      `400` |
| Conclusion     |      `400` |
| **Total**      | **`5800`** |

## Tell a story

Taken from 
- [Writing a Bachelor Tehsis in Computer Science](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~nijssensgr/bachelorklas-2014-2015/writing.pdf)

**MOST IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY**: First outline and then fill in the gaps. "Iterate, Iterate, Iterate"

The 3 steps to follow:

1. **Motivation - Why?**
   - Real World Applications
   - Earlier results and their weaknesses
     - Motivationg examples
2. **Problem Description - What?**
   - Requirements
   - Specification of the desirable functionality a user interface should have
   - Specification of the desirable functionality the application should have
3. **Approach - How?**
   - Architecture of the system I am Building
   - Description of the technologies (languages, services, libraries) used
   - Last: Implementation Details

**More:**
- Anyone with a degree comparable degree should be able to read the thesis
- Keep sentences as simple and as easily to understand as possible.
- Active tense, **not** passive tense
